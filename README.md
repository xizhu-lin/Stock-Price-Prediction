Predicting Stock Prices Using Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, Comparing between ARIMA Model and LSTM


This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Boeing and Zoom stock prices using historical daily data from January 1, 2020, to May 12, 2023. Employing ARIMA and LSTM models, the analysis focuses on forecasting stock prices amid significant market volatility. The dataset undergoes comprehensive pre-processing, and model parameters are selected based on statistical tests and criteria like AIC and BIC. Performance evaluation metrics, including MSE and RMSE, reveal distinctive outcomes for Boeing and Zoom, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of ARIMA and LSTM models in capturing stock price dynamics. The findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of stock market behavior during crises and the effectiveness of different forecasting models.
